# CockRoach — Live Project Context

> **Working file for the build team.** Updated continuously as work
> progresses. Read this first to know where the project stands.

**Last updated:** 2026-06-29

---

## 1 · Project & ownership

- **Product:** CockRoach — AI-powered entrepreneurial intelligence platform
- **Tagline:** "Not a unicorn. Better."
- **Parent company:** Layaa AI (CockRoach is to Layaa AI what ChatGPT is
  to OpenAI)
- **Vision:** End-to-end co-pilot for entrepreneurs covering idea
  discovery, validation, research, execution, fundraising, hiring, and
  ongoing decisions. Primary on execution, secondary on discovery.
- **Reference docs:**
  - `documentation.md` — full product vision and feature catalog
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md` — engineering internals
  - `SECURITY.md` — trust model + key rotation playbook
  - `README.md` — setup
  - `claude.md` — this file (project context, live)

---

## 2 · Team

| Role | Person | Responsibilities |
|---|---|---|
| Founder / Product | **Abhi** | Product direction, marketing, customer outreach, final calls |
| AI Engineer | Claude (this assistant) | Code drafts, specs, migrations, research, KB authoring, doc upkeep |

> Note: Shubham (tech lead) was on this project earlier but is now busy
> on other things. The build is currently a two-person effort: Abhi +
> Claude.

---

## 3 · Constraints (hard)

- **Budget:** $0 cash. $2000 in Azure startup credits (covers testing,
  prod inference until launch + early users)
- **Timeline:** target launch ~30 days from 2026-06-29 — **flexible**.
  Compress phases when work runs ahead; avoid idle time between phases.
  Sequencing (guidance, not calendar-gated):
  - Phase 0 (Day 0): Resolve git divergence
  - Phase 1 (Days 1–7): Product capability sprint
  - Phase 2 (Days 8–14): Test + bug fix
  - Phase 3 (Days 15–21): Auth + billing + email + marketing
  - Phase 4 (Days 22–28): Soft launch + iterate
  - Phase 5 (Days 29–35): Public launch (target ~end of July 2026)
- **No paid APIs in V1:** No Crunchbase, Ahrefs, SEMrush, Apollo, etc.
  Free sources only (Reddit JSON, ProductHunt RSS, public scrapes).
- **No SOC2 audit, no HIPAA, no GDPR full audit** at launch. Defer until
  post-revenue.

## 4 · Launch goal

A monetizable, self-serve SaaS at `cockroach.<domain>` (or whatever the
final domain is — see Open Questions §10).

**Free tier:** 5 chats/month, 1 active project, 1 idea-validation
report/month, 3 watermarked exports/month.

**Pro tier ($29/mo):** unlimited chat, up to 5 active projects, all 13
modes, unlimited exports unwatermarked, project memory + decision log
+ artifacts, brand kit, email support.

(Max / Team / Enterprise tiers come later — not in V1.)

**Marketing surface:** single landing page at root domain explaining
the product + a "Start free" CTA into the app.

## 5 · Build plan — day by day

### Phase 1: Build (Days 1–7, 2026-04-26 → 2026-05-02)

**Day 1 — TODAY (2026-04-26)**
- [ ] Resolve git divergence (15 remote commits vs our local commit) — BLOCKER for everything else
- [ ] Update `documentation.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` to reflect Layaa AI ownership + SaaS positioning
- [ ] Create this `claude.md` ✓
- [ ] Sketch Layaa AI brand identity (text logo + accent palette, can refine later)
- [ ] Open Stripe account (founder action)
- [ ] Open Resend account or AWS SES for transactional email (founder action)
- [ ] Decide final domain (founder action — see Open Questions §10)

**Day 2 (2026-04-27)**
- [ ] Replace no-auth UUID model with Supabase Auth (email/password + Google OAuth)
- [ ] Migrate `users.id` from `text` to `uuid` linked to `auth.users(id)`
- [ ] Backfill existing 4 profiles to Auth users (or fresh-start if data is throwaway)
- [ ] Enable RLS on every table; add per-user policies via `auth.uid()`
- [ ] Replace `GRANT ALL anon` with policy-driven access
- [ ] Rotate Supabase anon key (now actually meaningful)
- [ ] First-run flow: signup → email verify → onboarding tour

**Day 3 (2026-04-28)**
- [ ] Onboarding flow: 4-step (welcome → mode tour → "have an idea or want one?" → first chat)
- [ ] Founder Fit assessment (lightweight, persists as memory)
- [ ] Update `ProfileSelector` → become a real account-selector for orgs (deferred) / for now redirect to a single-account flow
- [ ] Introduce `org_id` table + plumbing (single-user-per-org for V1, ready for Team tier later)
- [ ] Account settings page (profile, password, sign out)

**Day 4 (2026-04-29)**
- [ ] Stripe integration: products, prices, checkout, customer portal
- [ ] Webhook handler for `customer.subscription.{created,updated,deleted}`
- [ ] `subscriptions` table on Supabase; tier resolution helper
- [ ] Free vs Pro tier feature gating in code (decorator pattern via `useTier()` hook)
- [ ] Quota enforcement on `/api/chat`: per-user counters, hard cap on free, soft on Pro

**Day 5 (2026-04-30)**
- [ ] Project spine migrations (Phase 1 from documentation.md):
  - extend `projects` table (stage, chosen_idea_id)
  - new `decisions` table
  - new `project_artifacts` table
  - add `project_id` FK to `chats` and `memory_items`
- [x] `useProjects` hook
- [ ] `/projects` list page (active-default view; stage filter chips; create modal; skeleton + empty state)
- [ ] Project detail page with 4 tabs: **Chats / Decisions / Artifacts / Inbox**
- [ ] **Decisions tab defaults to Reversibility Kanban** (Reversible / Expensive / One-way columns) — Notion launched this exact pattern Feb 2026; validates the Bezos schema design
- [ ] Decision form modal (category, question, decision, reversibility, optional pre_mortem + revisit_at)
- [ ] Inbox tab — actionable items: revisit-due / decay-near / pulse-overdue
- [ ] KPI strip on project detail from `health_score` jsonb
- [ ] **Project switcher in left sidebar** (Notion-style top-of-sidebar; higher discoverability than chat-header)
- [ ] "Start project from this chat" action
- [ ] Project-aware system prompt (latest 10 decisions + project description injected when active)
- [ ] Skeleton loaders (Linear/Stripe pattern) for list + detail tabs
- [ ] Empty states with action prompts (e.g., "Start your first project from a validation chat")

**Day 6 (2026-05-01)**
- [ ] Author 4 operator-mode KBs:
  - `kb/modes/PRICING.md`
  - `kb/modes/GO_TO_MARKET.md`
  - `kb/modes/FUNDRAISING.md`
  - `kb/modes/HIRING_AND_EQUITY.md`
- [ ] Wire into `kb-mode-loader.ts` + `APP_MODES`
- [ ] Mode reorder in nav: post-idea modes promoted; discovery modes in submenu
- [ ] Brand kit MVP: per-org logo upload + 1 accent color → applied to PPTX/PDF exports
- [ ] Watermark on free-tier exports

**Day 7 (2026-05-02)**
- [ ] Marketing landing page at root (chat moves to `/app`)
- [ ] Privacy policy + ToS (template-based via Termly or hand-written from a template)
- [ ] Cookie banner for EU visitors (if relevant)
- [ ] Sentry wired to logger
- [ ] PostHog wired for product analytics
- [ ] Cost-monitoring dashboard (LLM tokens per user, cumulative spend)
- [ ] Email templates: welcome, password reset, payment receipt, weekly digest stub
- [ ] Dry-run end-to-end: signup → onboarding → first project → chat → upgrade → export → cancel

### Phase 2: Test + bug fix (Days 8–14, 2026-05-03 → 2026-05-09)

- [ ] Internal team test (Abhishek, Shubham, the 4 default profiles as Layaa AI team accounts)
- [ ] Beta cohort (5–10 friends-and-family founders) with Pro access for free
- [ ] Daily bug bash → triage → fix → redeploy
- [ ] Cost monitoring: any user above expected token spend gets reviewed
- [ ] Onboarding refinement based on observed drop-off
- [ ] Mobile (PWA) sanity check on iOS Safari + Android Chrome
- [ ] Final security review: RLS policies tested for cross-user leakage, share tokens scoped correctly
- [ ] Performance: cold-start cost on Vercel functions, bundle size reduction (currently 3 MB / 920 KB gzip)

### Phase 3: Polish + soft launch (Days 15–25, 2026-05-10 → 2026-05-20)

- [ ] Open beta — invite list goes live (signup gated by waitlist or open)
- [ ] First 50 paying users
- [ ] Feedback loops: NPS pulse + in-app feedback widget
- [ ] Iterate on highest-friction points
- [ ] Marketing assets prep: ProductHunt page, HN launch text, demo video, screenshots, landing-page copy refinement, Twitter thread
- [ ] First weekly digest email goes out
- [ ] Affiliate / referral program scaffolding (deferred to post-launch if time-tight)

### Phase 4: Public launch (Days 26–35, 2026-05-21 → 2026-05-31)

- [ ] **Launch day = 2026-05-31** (or earlier if everything's green)
- [ ] ProductHunt + HN + Twitter coordinated launch
- [ ] Founder communities: Indie Hackers, IndiePass, r/Entrepreneur, r/SaaS
- [ ] Watch the support inbox + feedback channel for first 72 hours
- [ ] Hot-fix any issues
- [ ] Post-launch retrospective

## 6 · Current state snapshot (live)

**Build status:** ✓ typecheck clean · ✓ lint 0 errors (43 warnings, all `any` types, non-blocking)
**Deployed prod:** `cock-roach.vercel.app` (auto-deploys from `main`)
**Local + origin/main:** aligned at `aad125e` (docs: align documentation/architecture/claude.md for Layaa AI launch)
**Canonical remote:** `origin` → `https://github.com/4asaanAI/CockRoach.git` (Vercel-deployed; auto-deploys to `cock-roach.vercel.app` on push)
**Mirror remote:** `layaaai` → `https://github.com/layaaai222-art/CockRoach.git` (Layaa AI's repo; manually kept in sync)

> Note (2026-04-30): origin was briefly layaaai222-art but Vercel is
> hooked to 4asaanAI/CockRoach. Switched origin back. Future commits
> deploy automatically; push to `layaaai` separately if mirror needed.

**Phase 0 (git divergence) → ✅ DONE.**
**Phase 1 Day 1 → ✅ DONE** (legacy deletes; documentation.md + ARCHITECTURE.md updates).
**Phase 1 Day 2 (Project spine — data layer) → ✅ DONE** 2026-04-30.
**Phase 1 Day 3 (Project spine — UI) → ✅ DONE** 2026-04-30 (same-day; we ran ahead).
**Phase 1 Day 4 (Operator modes) → ✅ DONE** 2026-04-30 (still running ahead).
**Phase 1 Day 5 (Specialist modes + UI design + decision-log polish) → ✅ DONE** 2026-04-30.

**Day 2 progress (today, 2026-04-30):**
- ✅ Supabase MCP reconfigured to hosted HTTP + OAuth (project-scope `.mcp.json`).
- ✅ Migration `project_spine_full_schema` applied — extended `projects` (stage, chosen_idea_id, description, health_score, founder_fit_alignment, last_pulse_at) + new `decisions` / `project_artifacts` / `project_pulse_log` tables + nullable `project_id` FK on `chats` and `memory_items` + 9 indexes + unique pulse-per-week constraint + `updated_at` trigger.
- ✅ RLS disabled on the 4 project-spine tables for consistency with the no-auth model; `grant all` to anon+authenticated.
- ⏳ Local file work remaining → schema.sql / policies.sql updated · types.ts created · useProjects hook created · supabase.ts supports new publishable-key var name · `.env` + `.env.example` updated · docs being updated now.

**Backup branch:** `backup-c6a8a8f` (local, pre-merge commit; safe to delete).

**Open notes:**
- 1Password SSH-signing still failing on commits; using `commit.gpgsign=false` per-commit. Re-sign later when 1Password agent is reachable.
- Azure key was rotated 2026-04-30; new key in `.env` and Vercel.
- Supabase auth now via OAuth (hosted MCP at `https://mcp.supabase.com/mcp`); no PAT in chat history.

---

## 7 · Decisions made (with rationale)

- **No-auth model is acceptable for current 4–5 user state but MUST be replaced before public launch.** Phase 1 Day 2 is the auth migration.
- **Pro tier is the only paid tier at launch.** Max + Team + Enterprise come post-launch as we learn what users will pay extra for.
- **Free tier is generous (5 chats/month) by design** — needed for word-of-mouth growth; can tighten post-launch if costs run high.
- **Brutal Honesty stays as a per-user toggle, defaults to balanced.** Some users will love the personality, some will complain — toggle defuses both reactions.
- **No live data integrations at launch.** Crunchbase / Ahrefs / SEMrush / Apollo all $$$/month; out of $2000 budget. Use scrapers + free sources only.
- **No multi-user collab at launch.** Single-user-per-org for V1; org table is set up so Team tier can drop in later without schema rewrite.
- **PWA, not native apps, for V1 mobile reach.** Already comes for free with Vite.
- **Termly or template-based Privacy/ToS at launch.** Lawyer-reviewed comes when revenue justifies it.
- **Existing default profiles (DagnA / Subi / ManU / Gill Saab) become the Layaa AI team's free Pro accounts post-auth migration.**

## 8 · Open questions (need founder answers)

These block specific tasks. Asterisks mark blocking-Day-1.

1. *** Domain — `cockroach.ai`? `cockroach.app`? `cockroach.layaaai.com`? Subdomain split (marketing on root, app on `app.`)?
2. *** Merge — should I integrate the 15 remote commits into our local work? (Need permission to run `git merge`.) Or do you handle the merge yourself?
3. *** Stripe account — does Layaa AI already have one, or do you create one today?
4. *** Transactional email provider — Resend (cheaper, modern) or AWS SES (already-have-AWS scenarios)?
5. Logo — is there a Layaa AI / CockRoach logo asset, or do I generate a text-mark version for V1?
6. Beta cohort — do you have a friends-and-family list of 5–10 founders ready to test?
7. Existing 4 default profiles — keep their data after auth migration, or fresh-start everyone?
8. Are the avatar PNGs in `public/profiles/` final, or replace as part of brand refresh?
9. Pricing finalization — is `Free / Pro $29` the call, or do we want a different price point?
10. Launch list — who's our distribution channel on launch day? (Founder's network, ProductHunt, IndieHackers, paid ads?)
11. Azure credit timing — is the $2000 a one-time pool that expires, or refreshing? Affects how aggressive we can be in testing.

## 9 · Conventions & guardrails

- **Update protocol after every change** — claude reports: WHAT changed, HOW the platform changes, WHY beneficial, POINTERS to be aware of.
- **Update `documentation.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md`** alongside any feature change so they don't drift.
- **Update this file** with a new entry under §11 every working session.
- **Never bypass git signing** without explicit one-time approval.
- **Never force-push** without explicit "force push, I authorize destruction" instruction.
- **Brutal Honesty rule:** if a planned feature is harmful or strictly worse than an alternative, claude must flag before silently building. Timeline impossibility is OUT-OF-SCOPE for flagging — that's been acknowledged.
- **Cost-watch rule:** before any change that increases per-user LLM spend (longer prompts, more tools, multi-turn agents), claude states the projected token-impact and asks for go-ahead.
- **Question-first rule:** when claude is unsure about product direction or scope, ASK before building.

---

## 10 · Cost tracking

| Date | Azure spend (cumulative) | Trigger | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-04-22 | ~$0 | Session work | Internal-only usage so far |
| ... | | | |

**Budget breakdown for 35 days:**
- Azure inference budget: ~$1500 (leaves $500 buffer for unexpected)
- Daily testing burn: target <$30/day during Phase 1–2; tighten if spiking
- Public-launch buffer: $300 set aside for first 1000 free users hitting the API

**Kill-switch policy:** if cumulative Azure spend exceeds $1700 before
launch, freeze all non-essential testing and shift to mock-mode for QA.

## 11 · Update log

### 2026-04-26 — Plan kickoff (initial draft)
- Created `claude.md` (this file).
- Outlined 35-day plan from build → test → soft launch → public launch.
- Defined V1 scope: auth + billing + project spine + 4 operator modes
  + brand transition + marketing site.
- Identified 11 open questions blocking specific tasks.

### 2026-06-29 — Plan revision (founder corrections)
- Date corrected to today (2026-06-29).
- **Auth + billing + email moved to the END** (Phase 3) — founder
  wants product capability built first since no users exist yet.
- **Address founder as "Abhi"**, not Abhishek (saved to memory).
- **Two-person team**: Shubham off the project; build is Abhi + Claude.
- **Timeline flexible** — compress when ahead; minimize idle time.
- **Small-task discipline** — break big asks into atomic steps,
  use `/batch` on independent sub-tasks to avoid hallucination drift.
- **Update protocol** locked in: every change-set gets a 4-line report
  (What / Changes / Why beneficial / Pointers).
- Plan approved + saved at `~/.claude/plans/compressed-conjuring-wilkes.md`.
- Next action: Phase 0 git divergence resolution.

### 2026-06-29 — Phase 0 + Day 1 execution
- **Phase 0 (git divergence) ✅ resolved.** Reset local to origin/main
  (which had been silently integrated by another contributor, likely
  Shubham before stepping off). Restored `documentation.md` (only
  missing piece). Pushed as commit `2f48765`.
- **Phase 1 Day 1 progress:**
  - Deleted 4 legacy files (COCKROACH_AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md,
    COCKROACH_MASTER_PROMPT.md, metadata.json, supabase_schema.sql)
    that the other contributor restored. Authorized by Abhi. Pushed
    as `dbaf983`. -1064 lines, build still clean.
  - Updated `documentation.md` to reflect Layaa AI ownership +
    SaaS-launch positioning + 2026-06-29 date.
  - Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md` for Layaa AI parent + SaaS staging
    note.
  - This `claude.md` §6 + §11 entry being added now.
- **Verified post-merge:** typecheck ✓ / lint 0 errors / npm audit 0.
- **Backup branch `backup-c6a8a8f`** still local; safe to delete
  whenever Abhi wants.
- Next: complete Day 1 by committing the doc updates, then start
  Day 2 (Project spine — data layer migrations).

### 2026-04-30 — Phase 1 Day 2: Project spine (data layer)
- **Strategy lock-in.** Researched ChatGPT Projects, Claude Projects, and
  Bezos's Type-1/Type-2 doors framework. Both competitors offer
  sandboxed memory + file uploads; neither has structured decision logs,
  reversibility classification, or weekly pulse summaries. CockRoach's
  2x lever is the persistent venture-context layer with:
  - Decision log with reversibility (`reversible | expensive | one_way`)
    + `reversibility_decay_at` (decisions become harder to reverse over
    time; surface this).
  - Decision dependency graph via `depends_on_decision_id`.
  - Decision reversal trail via `reversed_at` + `reversed_by_decision_id`.
  - `pre_mortem` field captured at decision time.
  - Weekly auto-generated `project_pulse_log` summarising the project's
    state — Claude's 24h synthesis, but founder-focused + persisted.
  - Versioned `project_artifacts` with `parent_artifact_id` lineage
    (ChatGPT/Claude can't show diff between Pitch Deck v2 and v3; we
    will).
  - Project `health_score` + `founder_fit_alignment` JSONB fields for
    composite metrics over time.
- **Supabase MCP swap.** Moved from npx stdio (PAT-based) to hosted
  HTTP MCP at `https://mcp.supabase.com/mcp` with OAuth flow. Cleaner
  auth model — no PAT in chat history, no rotation needed for the MCP.
  `.mcp.json` at project scope so future sessions inherit the setup.
- **Migration `project_spine_full_schema` applied.** Extended `projects`
  with 6 new columns + stage check constraint; created `decisions`
  (16 cols + 5 indexes + 3 check constraints), `project_artifacts`
  (versioning + 3 indexes + 3 check constraints), `project_pulse_log`
  (1 unique index for project+week dedup); added nullable `project_id`
  FK on `chats` and `memory_items`; created `set_updated_at_now()`
  trigger function and bound it to `project_artifacts`.
- **Read flag finding.** New tables defaulted to RLS-on (Supabase
  default). Disabled RLS on the 4 spine tables to match the rest of
  the no-auth-phase schema; `grant all` to anon + authenticated.
- **Local file work shipped:**
  - `supabase/schema.sql` — full idempotent schema with all spine
    tables and indexes.
  - `supabase/policies.sql` — grants + RLS-disable for the 4 new
    tables.
  - `src/lib/types.ts` — TypeScript types for Project, Decision,
    ProjectArtifact, ProjectPulseLog plus enum metadata
    (PROJECT_STAGES, DECISION_CATEGORIES, REVERSIBILITY_LEVELS,
    ARTIFACT_KINDS).
  - `src/hooks/useProjects.ts` — fetch/create/update/archive/remove
    + memoised `byId`.
  - `src/lib/supabase.ts` — supports both `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
    (preferred) and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (legacy fallback).
  - `.env` updated with the new publishable key alongside the legacy
    JWT (gitignored).
  - `.env.example` updated to show new var as preferred.
- **Verified:** `npm run typecheck` passes; build pipeline clean.
- **Next:** Day 3 (Project spine — UI).
  - `/projects` list page + project detail page (4 tabs: Chats /
    Decisions / Artifacts / Reminders).
  - "Start project from this chat" action.
  - Project switcher in chat header.
  - Project-aware system prompt (latest 10 decisions + project
    description injected when active).
  - Mode reorder + Discovery submenu.

### 2026-04-30 — Phase 1 Day 3: Project spine (UI)
- **Research lock-in.** Investigated ChatGPT Projects, Claude Projects,
  Notion's new "Decision Tracker Kanban" template (Feb 2026), Linear,
  Vercel dashboard patterns, and 2026 SaaS UI trends. Two adoption
  decisions:
  - **Reversibility Kanban** as the default decisions view — Notion
    just shipped this exact pattern, validating Bezos's framework as
    a real UX primitive (not just a mental model).
  - **Project switcher in left sidebar (top, Notion workspace-pattern)**
    rather than chat header — higher discoverability per Notion's
    workspace-switcher design.
- **Shipped (3 commits, all today):**
  - **Batch A** (`7b412b1`): hooks + project list page.
    - `useDecisions(projectId)` — fetch + log + markRevisited + reverse
      (with full reversal trail). The `reverse()` helper inserts a
      replacement decision and stamps the original with `reversed_at`
      + `reversed_by_decision_id`, so no decision history is ever lost.
    - `useArtifacts(projectId)` — fetch + save + saveNewVersion
      (auto-bumps `version` and sets `parent_artifact_id`) + remove.
    - `usePulseLog(projectId)` — read-only fetcher; pulse generation
      is server-side later.
    - `useProjectInbox({ project, decisions, pulseLogs })` — pure
      derivation surfacing actionable items: revisit_due / decay_near /
      pulse_overdue / no_recent_activity. Sorted by severity → days
      overdue.
    - `ProjectsList` component with stage-color-coded cards, filter
      chips (Active / All / per-stage), skeleton loaders (Stripe
      pattern), empty state with action prompt.
    - `CreateProjectModal` with name + description + stage selector.
  - **Batch B** (`b1d29dd`): project detail page + 4 tabs +
    decision form modal.
    - `ProjectDetail` with header (rename in place, stage selector
      dropdown, archive button), KPI strip (Linear/Vercel pattern;
      tiles for Created / Last activity / Health / Pulse), 4 tabs.
    - `ChatsTab` — chats with this project's `project_id`; click
      switches to chat view with that chat active.
    - `DecisionsTab` — defaults to **Reversibility Kanban** with 3
      columns (Reversible / Expensive / One-way). Each column gets
      its own colored border and inline help (Bezos reasoning surfaced
      to the user). Card shows: category, question (truncated), decision
      (truncated), confidence, decided-at, plus indicator badges
      (Reversed strikethrough, Revisit due clock, Decay-near alert).
      Toggle to flat List view.
    - `DecisionFormModal` — category grid (11 categories), question +
      decision required textareas, **visual reversibility selector
      with inline Bezos help text** (educates users on the framework),
      confidence pills, optional rationale, collapsible advanced
      section with `pre_mortem` ("if wrong, what's the most likely
      failure mode?") and `revisit_at` date picker.
    - `ArtifactsTab` — kind-color-coded grid; follows
      `parent_artifact_id` chain to find the latest version of each
      artifact root; shows version count and exported_format badge.
    - `InboxTab` — surfaces useProjectInbox items with severity badges
      and original-decision context where applicable.
  - **Batch C** (this commit): sidebar project switcher + project-aware
    system prompt + chat→project linking.
    - `ProjectSwitcher` in left sidebar (top, between brand and
      "New Conversation"). Notion-style: shows current active project +
      caret; dropdown reveals up to 8 active projects + "Manage all
      projects" + "Create new project". Clear button (X) when active.
    - `formatProjectContext(project, decisions)` in `lib/project-context.ts`
      — formats project + latest 10 non-reversed decisions into a
      markdown block for system-prompt injection. Includes pre-mortems.
      Tells the agent: "If the user is about to contradict a recent
      one-way-door decision, flag it before answering."
    - `system-prompt-builder.ts` extended with optional `projectContext`
      param; emits `[PROJECT CONTEXT]…[/PROJECT CONTEXT]` block before
      memory context.
    - App.tsx wires it: useProjects + useDecisions scoped to
      activeProjectId, computes projectContext via useMemo, passes to
      every `buildSystemPrompt` call.
    - New chats inherit `activeProjectId` automatically when inserted.
- **Verified:** `npm run typecheck` passes through all 3 batches;
  `npm run lint` 0 errors (42 pre-existing `any` warnings).
- **Skipped for Day 3 (deferred):** "Anchor existing chat to project"
  pill in chat header (small UX polish; existing chats can be moved
  later); decision dependency graph viz (Day 5+); pulse widget
  visualization (Day 5/6 once first pulse logs exist); cross-project
  search (Day 5).
- **Next:** Day 4 (operator modes — PRICING, GO_TO_MARKET, FUNDRAISING,
  HIRING_AND_EQUITY) + mode reorder + Discovery submenu.

### 2026-04-30 — Phase 1 Day 5: Specialist modes + UI design + decision-log polish
- **Founder ask added during Day 5:** include a UI/UX design skill so
  users can spec the website/app interface for their idea. Synthesized
  with planned specialist modes.
- **Research lock-in.** Pulled current data on each topic:
  - Customer discovery: Mom Test rules (talk life not idea, past
    specifics not future generics, ask "what/how" not "why",
    compliments are fake signal); JTBD timeline questions; segmentation
    by job + pain + authority + urgency; saturation stop rule (3
    consecutive no-news interviews).
  - Legal & ops 2026: Delaware C-corp = VC standard; LLC-to-C-corp
    conversion is $5K-$25K + tax pain so don't take an LLC if raising;
    IP assignment = "single most important legal doc for tech";
    83(b) within 30 days mandatory; FTC non-compete ruling 2024+.
  - Pivot framework (Ries): runway redefined as "pivots remaining, not
    months"; 11 pivot types named; sunk-cost language detector;
    decision matrix with 7 honest signals → score → call.
  - UI design 2026: v0 (code-first React+shadcn), Lovable (full-stack
    with backend+DB), Figma Make / First Draft, Google Stitch 2.0.
    **2x angle: be the strategic upstream — produce structured 5-layer
    specs that 10x the output of these tools** rather than try to be
    them.
- **Shipped (single commit):**
  - 4 new mode KBs in `kb/modes/`:
    - `CUSTOMER_DISCOVERY.md` — Mom Test rules, banned vs approved
      question patterns, JTBD timeline, ICP scoring, saturation stop
      rules. Produces interview script + outreach template + synthesis
      matrix as artifacts.
    - `LEGAL_AND_OPS.md` — entity decision table (Delaware C-corp vs
      LLC vs PBC), Day-0 docs checklist (founder vesting + IP
      assignment + 83(b)), compliance flag matrix by domain (HIPAA /
      PCI / COPPA / GDPR / CCPA / SOC 2 / AI laws / FinSvc / Crypto),
      founder traps section. Explicit "needs a real lawyer" line.
    - `PIVOT_OR_PERSEVERE.md` — Build-Measure-Learn framing, 5 pre-
      questions (real data? hypothesis decomposition? cheapest test?
      data vs feeling? pivot pre-mortem?), 11 Ries pivot types, 7-row
      decision matrix scoring 7-35 → recommendation. Brutal honesty
      built in.
    - `UI_DESIGN.md` — **NEW per founder ask.** 5-layer spec
      framework: IA tree → page-level wireframe specs → design system
      tokens → component inventory → tool-specific paste-ready prompt
      (v0 / Lovable / Figma Make / Stitch). Brand-kit-aware. Doesn't
      try to draw pixels — produces specs that 10x the AI design
      tools' output.
  - `kb-mode-loader.ts` — 4 new ?raw imports + entries (now 17 mode
    KBs total + Skills KB).
  - `App.tsx` APP_MODES — added 4 modes with right groupings:
    - `core`: PIVOT_OR_PERSEVERE (decision-making)
    - `operator`: CUSTOMER_DISCOVERY, LEGAL_AND_OPS
    - `creative`: UI_DESIGN (joins IMAGE_PROMPTING)
    - Icons added: Headphones, Scale, GitBranch, LayoutDashboard.
- **Decision-log polish (the second Day 5 deliverable):**
  - `DecisionFormModal` accepts new optional `defaultCategory` prop;
    pre-selects category when opened with context.
  - `App.tsx` adds `modeToDecisionCategory(mode)` mapper that translates
    the active working mode → the decision category that fits best
    (PRICING → pricing, GO_TO_MARKET → gtm, FUNDRAISING → fundraise,
    HIRING_AND_EQUITY → hiring, LEGAL_AND_OPS → legal,
    PIVOT_OR_PERSEVERE → pivot, POSITIONING → positioning,
    IDEA_VALIDATION/CUSTOMER_DISCOVERY → validation, BUSINESS_MODEL/
    EXECUTION/UI_DESIGN → product, others → other).
  - **"Log decision" button** added to chat header (desktop only,
    visible when project is active). Click → DecisionFormModal opens
    pre-filled with project + user + mode-mapped category. Founder can
    capture any strategic call mid-chat without leaving the
    conversation.
- **Verified:** typecheck ✓, lint 0 errors (42 pre-existing warnings).
- **Skipped (Day 6 territory):** "Save as artifact" prompt on every
  export inside a project; revisit-due banner on app load; project
  pulse summary auto-generation (server-side cron).
- **Next:** Day 6 (frameworks library — Value Equation, ACP, Value
  Matrix, Value Ladder + "Run framework" quick action on project
  page).
- **Research lock-in.** Pulled 2026 data on each topic to make the KBs
  decision-ready, not generic:
  - PRICING: Van Westendorp PSM still gold standard; anchor Pro tier
    near $29/seat; max 3-4 tiers (>4 cuts conversion ~30%); 1% pricing
    improvement = 11% op-profit lift; tiered base + usage overage is
    2026 default; value metrics correlate with 30% growth + 15-26%
    retention lift.
  - GTM: Hybrid PLG+SLG is default $5K-$50K ACV (2x revenue growth vs
    pure-SLG); pure PLG below $5K, pure SLG above $50K with multi-
    stakeholder buys. Bullseye framework for channel selection.
  - FUNDRAISING: SAFEs = 90% of pre-seed, 64% of seed (Q1 2025); SAFE
    stacks with conflicting MFNs cause retroactive cap-table chaos;
    inverted cap tables (investors > founders) = uninvestable; founder
    ownership red zones documented per stage.
  - HIRING: FAST framework (3 stages × 3 advisor levels); founders/
    employees 4yr/1yr-cliff non-negotiable; advisors 2yr/3mo-cliff;
    10-20% option pool; first 10 employees collectively ~10% equity.
- **Shipped (single commit):**
  - 4 new mode KBs in `kb/modes/`:
    - `PRICING.md` — model/structure/levels/packaging decisions; van
      Westendorp + Gabor-Granger scripts; 7-row model selection table;
      tiered packaging traps; produces pricing-page copy + survey +
      sensitivity model artifacts.
    - `GO_TO_MARKET.md` — ACV-based motion framework; full Bullseye
      19-channel taxonomy; CAC math non-negotiables; first-100-customer
      Lenny's Newsletter pattern; produces email sequences + cold call
      scripts + landing page copy + CAC sensitivity model.
    - `FUNDRAISING.md` — raise-or-not test; SAFE vs priced with hard
      rules ("max 2 SAFE rounds before priced"; "no MFNs"); 2026 stage
      benchmarks for raise size + dilution; Sequoia-style 12-slide
      deck spec; term-sheet red flags table with push-back language;
      produces deck + cap table + investor list + cold email artifacts.
    - `HIRING_AND_EQUITY.md` — first-5 sequencing per stage; full
      employee equity bands by hire # × stage × seniority; FAST
      advisor framework table; vesting architecture (4y/1y cliff;
      double-trigger acceleration; refresh grants; 83(b) elections);
      sourcing flow with red flags; produces JD + offer template +
      cap table impact + reference script.
  - `kb-mode-loader.ts` — added 4 imports + 4 entries (now 13 mode KBs
    + always-on Skills KB).
  - `App.tsx` — APP_MODES restructured with `group` field
    (`core | operator | discovery | creative`); 4 new modes added
    (PRICING, GO_TO_MARKET, FUNDRAISING, HIRING_AND_EQUITY); icons
    Tag, Target, PiggyBank, UserPlus added.
  - **Mode picker UI** — now renders grouped sections with subtle
    headers (Core / Build the business / Find an idea / Creative
    tools). Discovery modes (IDEA_GENERATION, IDEA_VALIDATION) moved
    out of top-of-list — they're for the secondary "no idea yet"
    entry path. Operator modes promoted to the prominent middle
    section. IMAGE_PROMPTING moved to Creative.
- **Verified:** typecheck ✓, lint 0 errors (42 pre-existing warnings).
- **Skipped (deferred to Day 5):** Brand kit MVP (per-org logo upload
  + accent color applied to exports) — simpler with auth + tier
  context; postpone to Phase 3. Watermark on free-tier exports —
  same; depends on auth/tier.
- **Next:** Day 5 (specialist modes — CUSTOMER_DISCOVERY,
  LEGAL_AND_OPS, PIVOT_OR_PERSEVERE) + decision-log UX polish in
  chat.
