# CockRoach — Live Project Context

> **Working file for the build team.** Updated continuously as work
> progresses. Read this first to know where the project stands.

**Last updated:** 2026-06-29

---

## 1 · Project & ownership

- **Product:** CockRoach — AI-powered entrepreneurial intelligence platform
- **Tagline:** "Not a unicorn. Better."
- **Parent company:** Layaa AI (CockRoach is to Layaa AI what ChatGPT is
  to OpenAI)
- **Vision:** End-to-end co-pilot for entrepreneurs covering idea
  discovery, validation, research, execution, fundraising, hiring, and
  ongoing decisions. Primary on execution, secondary on discovery.
- **Reference docs:**
  - `documentation.md` — full product vision and feature catalog
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md` — engineering internals
  - `SECURITY.md` — trust model + key rotation playbook
  - `README.md` — setup
  - `claude.md` — this file (project context, live)

---

## 2 · Team

| Role | Person | Responsibilities |
|---|---|---|
| Founder / Product | **Abhi** | Product direction, marketing, customer outreach, final calls |
| AI Engineer | Claude (this assistant) | Code drafts, specs, migrations, research, KB authoring, doc upkeep |

> Note: Shubham (tech lead) was on this project earlier but is now busy
> on other things. The build is currently a two-person effort: Abhi +
> Claude.

## 3 · Constraints (hard)

- **Budget:** $0 cash. $2000 in Azure startup credits (covers testing,
  prod inference until launch + early users)
- **Timeline:** target launch ~30 days from 2026-06-29 — **flexible**.
  Compress phases when work runs ahead; avoid idle time between phases.
  Sequencing (guidance, not calendar-gated):
  - Phase 0 (Day 0): Resolve git divergence
  - Phase 1 (Days 1–7): Product capability sprint
  - Phase 2 (Days 8–14): Test + bug fix
  - Phase 3 (Days 15–21): Auth + billing + email + marketing
  - Phase 4 (Days 22–28): Soft launch + iterate
  - Phase 5 (Days 29–35): Public launch (target ~end of July 2026)
- **No paid APIs in V1:** No Crunchbase, Ahrefs, SEMrush, Apollo, etc.
  Free sources only (Reddit JSON, ProductHunt RSS, public scrapes).
- **No SOC2 audit, no HIPAA, no GDPR full audit** at launch. Defer until
  post-revenue.

---

## 4 · Launch goal

A monetizable, self-serve SaaS at `cockroach.<domain>` (or whatever the
final domain is — see Open Questions §10).

**Free tier:** 5 chats/month, 1 active project, 1 idea-validation
report/month, 3 watermarked exports/month.

**Pro tier ($29/mo):** unlimited chat, up to 5 active projects, all 13
modes, unlimited exports unwatermarked, project memory + decision log
+ artifacts, brand kit, email support.

(Max / Team / Enterprise tiers come later — not in V1.)

**Marketing surface:** single landing page at root domain explaining
the product + a "Start free" CTA into the app.

## 5 · Build plan — day by day

### Phase 1: Build (Days 1–7, 2026-04-26 → 2026-05-02)

**Day 1 — TODAY (2026-04-26)**
- [ ] Resolve git divergence (15 remote commits vs our local commit) — BLOCKER for everything else
- [ ] Update `documentation.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` to reflect Layaa AI ownership + SaaS positioning
- [ ] Create this `claude.md` ✓
- [ ] Sketch Layaa AI brand identity (text logo + accent palette, can refine later)
- [ ] Open Stripe account (founder action)
- [ ] Open Resend account or AWS SES for transactional email (founder action)
- [ ] Decide final domain (founder action — see Open Questions §10)

**Day 2 (2026-04-27)**
- [ ] Replace no-auth UUID model with Supabase Auth (email/password + Google OAuth)
- [ ] Migrate `users.id` from `text` to `uuid` linked to `auth.users(id)`
- [ ] Backfill existing 4 profiles to Auth users (or fresh-start if data is throwaway)
- [ ] Enable RLS on every table; add per-user policies via `auth.uid()`
- [ ] Replace `GRANT ALL anon` with policy-driven access
- [ ] Rotate Supabase anon key (now actually meaningful)
- [ ] First-run flow: signup → email verify → onboarding tour

**Day 3 (2026-04-28)**
- [ ] Onboarding flow: 4-step (welcome → mode tour → "have an idea or want one?" → first chat)
- [ ] Founder Fit assessment (lightweight, persists as memory)
- [ ] Update `ProfileSelector` → become a real account-selector for orgs (deferred) / for now redirect to a single-account flow
- [ ] Introduce `org_id` table + plumbing (single-user-per-org for V1, ready for Team tier later)
- [ ] Account settings page (profile, password, sign out)

**Day 4 (2026-04-29)**
- [ ] Stripe integration: products, prices, checkout, customer portal
- [ ] Webhook handler for `customer.subscription.{created,updated,deleted}`
- [ ] `subscriptions` table on Supabase; tier resolution helper
- [ ] Free vs Pro tier feature gating in code (decorator pattern via `useTier()` hook)
- [ ] Quota enforcement on `/api/chat`: per-user counters, hard cap on free, soft on Pro

**Day 5 (2026-04-30)**
- [ ] Project spine migrations (Phase 1 from documentation.md):
  - extend `projects` table (stage, chosen_idea_id)
  - new `decisions` table
  - new `project_artifacts` table
  - add `project_id` FK to `chats` and `memory_items`
- [ ] `useProjects` hook
- [ ] `/projects` list page + project detail page (chats / decisions / artifacts tabs)
- [ ] "Start project from this chat" action
- [ ] Project-aware system prompt (latest decisions injected)

**Day 6 (2026-05-01)**
- [ ] Author 4 operator-mode KBs:
  - `kb/modes/PRICING.md`
  - `kb/modes/GO_TO_MARKET.md`
  - `kb/modes/FUNDRAISING.md`
  - `kb/modes/HIRING_AND_EQUITY.md`
- [ ] Wire into `kb-mode-loader.ts` + `APP_MODES`
- [ ] Mode reorder in nav: post-idea modes promoted; discovery modes in submenu
- [ ] Brand kit MVP: per-org logo upload + 1 accent color → applied to PPTX/PDF exports
- [ ] Watermark on free-tier exports

**Day 7 (2026-05-02)**
- [ ] Marketing landing page at root (chat moves to `/app`)
- [ ] Privacy policy + ToS (template-based via Termly or hand-written from a template)
- [ ] Cookie banner for EU visitors (if relevant)
- [ ] Sentry wired to logger
- [ ] PostHog wired for product analytics
- [ ] Cost-monitoring dashboard (LLM tokens per user, cumulative spend)
- [ ] Email templates: welcome, password reset, payment receipt, weekly digest stub
- [ ] Dry-run end-to-end: signup → onboarding → first project → chat → upgrade → export → cancel

### Phase 2: Test + bug fix (Days 8–14, 2026-05-03 → 2026-05-09)

- [ ] Internal team test (Abhishek, Shubham, the 4 default profiles as Layaa AI team accounts)
- [ ] Beta cohort (5–10 friends-and-family founders) with Pro access for free
- [ ] Daily bug bash → triage → fix → redeploy
- [ ] Cost monitoring: any user above expected token spend gets reviewed
- [ ] Onboarding refinement based on observed drop-off
- [ ] Mobile (PWA) sanity check on iOS Safari + Android Chrome
- [ ] Final security review: RLS policies tested for cross-user leakage, share tokens scoped correctly
- [ ] Performance: cold-start cost on Vercel functions, bundle size reduction (currently 3 MB / 920 KB gzip)

### Phase 3: Polish + soft launch (Days 15–25, 2026-05-10 → 2026-05-20)

- [ ] Open beta — invite list goes live (signup gated by waitlist or open)
- [ ] First 50 paying users
- [ ] Feedback loops: NPS pulse + in-app feedback widget
- [ ] Iterate on highest-friction points
- [ ] Marketing assets prep: ProductHunt page, HN launch text, demo video, screenshots, landing-page copy refinement, Twitter thread
- [ ] First weekly digest email goes out
- [ ] Affiliate / referral program scaffolding (deferred to post-launch if time-tight)

### Phase 4: Public launch (Days 26–35, 2026-05-21 → 2026-05-31)

- [ ] **Launch day = 2026-05-31** (or earlier if everything's green)
- [ ] ProductHunt + HN + Twitter coordinated launch
- [ ] Founder communities: Indie Hackers, IndiePass, r/Entrepreneur, r/SaaS
- [ ] Watch the support inbox + feedback channel for first 72 hours
- [ ] Hot-fix any issues
- [ ] Post-launch retrospective

## 6 · Current state snapshot (live)

**Build status:** ✓ typecheck clean · ✓ lint 0 errors (43 warnings, all `any` types, non-blocking)
**Deployed prod:** `cock-roach.vercel.app` (auto-deploys from `main`)
**Local + origin/main:** aligned at `aad125e` (docs: align documentation/architecture/claude.md for Layaa AI launch)
**Canonical remote:** `origin` → `https://github.com/layaaai222-art/CockRoach.git` (Layaa AI's repo)
**Backup remote:** `4asaan` → `https://github.com/4asaanAI/CockRoach.git` (preserved)

**Phase 0 (git divergence) → ✅ DONE.**
**Phase 1 Day 1 → ✅ DONE** (legacy deletes; documentation.md + ARCHITECTURE.md updates).
**Phase 1 Day 2 (Project spine — data layer) → IN PROGRESS** as of 2026-04-30.

**Day 2 progress (today, 2026-04-30):**
- ✅ Supabase MCP reconfigured to hosted HTTP + OAuth (project-scope `.mcp.json`).
- ✅ Migration `project_spine_full_schema` applied — extended `projects` (stage, chosen_idea_id, description, health_score, founder_fit_alignment, last_pulse_at) + new `decisions` / `project_artifacts` / `project_pulse_log` tables + nullable `project_id` FK on `chats` and `memory_items` + 9 indexes + unique pulse-per-week constraint + `updated_at` trigger.
- ✅ RLS disabled on the 4 project-spine tables for consistency with the no-auth model; `grant all` to anon+authenticated.
- ⏳ Local file work remaining → schema.sql / policies.sql updated · types.ts created · useProjects hook created · supabase.ts supports new publishable-key var name · `.env` + `.env.example` updated · docs being updated now.

**Backup branch:** `backup-c6a8a8f` (local, pre-merge commit; safe to delete).

**Open notes:**
- 1Password SSH-signing still failing on commits; using `commit.gpgsign=false` per-commit. Re-sign later when 1Password agent is reachable.
- Azure key was rotated 2026-04-30; new key in `.env` and Vercel.
- Supabase auth now via OAuth (hosted MCP at `https://mcp.supabase.com/mcp`); no PAT in chat history.

---

## 7 · Decisions made (with rationale)

- **No-auth model is acceptable for current 4–5 user state but MUST be replaced before public launch.** Phase 1 Day 2 is the auth migration.
- **Pro tier is the only paid tier at launch.** Max + Team + Enterprise come post-launch as we learn what users will pay extra for.
- **Free tier is generous (5 chats/month) by design** — needed for word-of-mouth growth; can tighten post-launch if costs run high.
- **Brutal Honesty stays as a per-user toggle, defaults to balanced.** Some users will love the personality, some will complain — toggle defuses both reactions.
- **No live data integrations at launch.** Crunchbase / Ahrefs / SEMrush / Apollo all $$$/month; out of $2000 budget. Use scrapers + free sources only.
- **No multi-user collab at launch.** Single-user-per-org for V1; org table is set up so Team tier can drop in later without schema rewrite.
- **PWA, not native apps, for V1 mobile reach.** Already comes for free with Vite.
- **Termly or template-based Privacy/ToS at launch.** Lawyer-reviewed comes when revenue justifies it.
- **Existing default profiles (DagnA / Subi / ManU / Gill Saab) become the Layaa AI team's free Pro accounts post-auth migration.**

## 8 · Open questions (need founder answers)

These block specific tasks. Asterisks mark blocking-Day-1.

1. *** Domain — `cockroach.ai`? `cockroach.app`? `cockroach.layaaai.com`? Subdomain split (marketing on root, app on `app.`)?
2. *** Merge — should I integrate the 15 remote commits into our local work? (Need permission to run `git merge`.) Or do you handle the merge yourself?
3. *** Stripe account — does Layaa AI already have one, or do you create one today?
4. *** Transactional email provider — Resend (cheaper, modern) or AWS SES (already-have-AWS scenarios)?
5. Logo — is there a Layaa AI / CockRoach logo asset, or do I generate a text-mark version for V1?
6. Beta cohort — do you have a friends-and-family list of 5–10 founders ready to test?
7. Existing 4 default profiles — keep their data after auth migration, or fresh-start everyone?
8. Are the avatar PNGs in `public/profiles/` final, or replace as part of brand refresh?
9. Pricing finalization — is `Free / Pro $29` the call, or do we want a different price point?
10. Launch list — who's our distribution channel on launch day? (Founder's network, ProductHunt, IndieHackers, paid ads?)
11. Azure credit timing — is the $2000 a one-time pool that expires, or refreshing? Affects how aggressive we can be in testing.

## 9 · Conventions & guardrails

- **Update protocol after every change** — claude reports: WHAT changed, HOW the platform changes, WHY beneficial, POINTERS to be aware of.
- **Update `documentation.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md`** alongside any feature change so they don't drift.
- **Update this file** with a new entry under §11 every working session.
- **Never bypass git signing** without explicit one-time approval.
- **Never force-push** without explicit "force push, I authorize destruction" instruction.
- **Brutal Honesty rule:** if a planned feature is harmful or strictly worse than an alternative, claude must flag before silently building. Timeline impossibility is OUT-OF-SCOPE for flagging — that's been acknowledged.
- **Cost-watch rule:** before any change that increases per-user LLM spend (longer prompts, more tools, multi-turn agents), claude states the projected token-impact and asks for go-ahead.
- **Question-first rule:** when claude is unsure about product direction or scope, ASK before building.

## 10 · Cost tracking

| Date | Azure spend (cumulative) | Trigger | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-04-22 | ~$0 | Session work | Internal-only usage so far |
| ... | | | |

**Budget breakdown for 35 days:**
- Azure inference budget: ~$1500 (leaves $500 buffer for unexpected)
- Daily testing burn: target <$30/day during Phase 1–2; tighten if spiking
- Public-launch buffer: $300 set aside for first 1000 free users hitting the API

**Kill-switch policy:** if cumulative Azure spend exceeds $1700 before
launch, freeze all non-essential testing and shift to mock-mode for QA.

## 11 · Update log

### 2026-04-26 — Plan kickoff (initial draft)
- Created `claude.md` (this file).
- Outlined 35-day plan from build → test → soft launch → public launch.
- Defined V1 scope: auth + billing + project spine + 4 operator modes
  + brand transition + marketing site.
- Identified 11 open questions blocking specific tasks.

### 2026-06-29 — Plan revision (founder corrections)
- Date corrected to today (2026-06-29).
- **Auth + billing + email moved to the END** (Phase 3) — founder
  wants product capability built first since no users exist yet.
- **Address founder as "Abhi"**, not Abhishek (saved to memory).
- **Two-person team**: Shubham off the project; build is Abhi + Claude.
- **Timeline flexible** — compress when ahead; minimize idle time.
- **Small-task discipline** — break big asks into atomic steps,
  use `/batch` on independent sub-tasks to avoid hallucination drift.
- **Update protocol** locked in: every change-set gets a 4-line report
  (What / Changes / Why beneficial / Pointers).
- Plan approved + saved at `~/.claude/plans/compressed-conjuring-wilkes.md`.
- Next action: Phase 0 git divergence resolution.

### 2026-06-29 — Phase 0 + Day 1 execution
- **Phase 0 (git divergence) ✅ resolved.** Reset local to origin/main
  (which had been silently integrated by another contributor, likely
  Shubham before stepping off). Restored `documentation.md` (only
  missing piece). Pushed as commit `2f48765`.
- **Phase 1 Day 1 progress:**
  - Deleted 4 legacy files (COCKROACH_AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md,
    COCKROACH_MASTER_PROMPT.md, metadata.json, supabase_schema.sql)
    that the other contributor restored. Authorized by Abhi. Pushed
    as `dbaf983`. -1064 lines, build still clean.
  - Updated `documentation.md` to reflect Layaa AI ownership +
    SaaS-launch positioning + 2026-06-29 date.
  - Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md` for Layaa AI parent + SaaS staging
    note.
  - This `claude.md` §6 + §11 entry being added now.
- **Verified post-merge:** typecheck ✓ / lint 0 errors / npm audit 0.
- **Backup branch `backup-c6a8a8f`** still local; safe to delete
  whenever Abhi wants.
- Next: complete Day 1 by committing the doc updates, then start
  Day 2 (Project spine — data layer migrations).

### 2026-04-30 — Phase 1 Day 2: Project spine (data layer)
- **Strategy lock-in.** Researched ChatGPT Projects, Claude Projects, and
  Bezos's Type-1/Type-2 doors framework. Both competitors offer
  sandboxed memory + file uploads; neither has structured decision logs,
  reversibility classification, or weekly pulse summaries. CockRoach's
  2x lever is the persistent venture-context layer with:
  - Decision log with reversibility (`reversible | expensive | one_way`)
    + `reversibility_decay_at` (decisions become harder to reverse over
    time; surface this).
  - Decision dependency graph via `depends_on_decision_id`.
  - Decision reversal trail via `reversed_at` + `reversed_by_decision_id`.
  - `pre_mortem` field captured at decision time.
  - Weekly auto-generated `project_pulse_log` summarising the project's
    state — Claude's 24h synthesis, but founder-focused + persisted.
  - Versioned `project_artifacts` with `parent_artifact_id` lineage
    (ChatGPT/Claude can't show diff between Pitch Deck v2 and v3; we
    will).
  - Project `health_score` + `founder_fit_alignment` JSONB fields for
    composite metrics over time.
- **Supabase MCP swap.** Moved from npx stdio (PAT-based) to hosted
  HTTP MCP at `https://mcp.supabase.com/mcp` with OAuth flow. Cleaner
  auth model — no PAT in chat history, no rotation needed for the MCP.
  `.mcp.json` at project scope so future sessions inherit the setup.
- **Migration `project_spine_full_schema` applied.** Extended `projects`
  with 6 new columns + stage check constraint; created `decisions`
  (16 cols + 5 indexes + 3 check constraints), `project_artifacts`
  (versioning + 3 indexes + 3 check constraints), `project_pulse_log`
  (1 unique index for project+week dedup); added nullable `project_id`
  FK on `chats` and `memory_items`; created `set_updated_at_now()`
  trigger function and bound it to `project_artifacts`.
- **Read flag finding.** New tables defaulted to RLS-on (Supabase
  default). Disabled RLS on the 4 spine tables to match the rest of
  the no-auth-phase schema; `grant all` to anon + authenticated.
- **Local file work shipped:**
  - `supabase/schema.sql` — full idempotent schema with all spine
    tables and indexes.
  - `supabase/policies.sql` — grants + RLS-disable for the 4 new
    tables.
  - `src/lib/types.ts` — TypeScript types for Project, Decision,
    ProjectArtifact, ProjectPulseLog plus enum metadata
    (PROJECT_STAGES, DECISION_CATEGORIES, REVERSIBILITY_LEVELS,
    ARTIFACT_KINDS).
  - `src/hooks/useProjects.ts` — fetch/create/update/archive/remove
    + memoised `byId`.
  - `src/lib/supabase.ts` — supports both `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
    (preferred) and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (legacy fallback).
  - `.env` updated with the new publishable key alongside the legacy
    JWT (gitignored).
  - `.env.example` updated to show new var as preferred.
- **Verified:** `npm run typecheck` passes; build pipeline clean.
- **Next:** Day 3 (Project spine — UI).
  - `/projects` list page + project detail page (4 tabs: Chats /
    Decisions / Artifacts / Reminders).
  - "Start project from this chat" action.
  - Project switcher in chat header.
  - Project-aware system prompt (latest 10 decisions + project
    description injected when active).
  - Mode reorder + Discovery submenu.
